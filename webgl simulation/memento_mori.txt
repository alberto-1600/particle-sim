this folder contains some different failed attempts by me to somehow run particle to particle collision on the gpu. This has proved harder than anticipated. i've now realized after many days of useless work that i am not in the condition nor capacity of learning shaders and such. this text file remains as a reminder to my future self and whoever has access to this repository that sometimes failing is ok. This serves to remember that we should not get excited and thrive on pride because we still are humans, and we are gonna die.
