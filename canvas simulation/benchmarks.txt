Some benchmarks to keep track of progress of the simulation

13/09/2025 
Grid-Optimization particle to particle collision

radius: 2
velocities: [-5,5]
window_size: 600x600
steps: 2
fps: 60

we check the maximum amount (N) of particles that can keep up with 60fps with the aforementioned parameters. 
N: 5600
